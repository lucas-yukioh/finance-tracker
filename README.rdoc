Second app from "The Complete Ruby on Rails Developer Course" by Mashrur Hossain.
Finance Tracker is a simple app for searching and tracking stocks. Users can sign up, search for a stock, add it to the portfolio and they also have a profile page where they can add friends.

The main focus of this app is:
- Use devise for authentication for fast setup;
- Customize devise to add first name and last name to the users;
- Use ajax to the submission and display on the search functionality;
- Create friendships association and follow friends;
- Use a gem to lookup stocks and get stock prices.
